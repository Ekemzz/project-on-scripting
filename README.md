**Part 1: Use list form for-loop**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Below are the block of codes in the image. 
1. Functions that would generate the types of multiplication table as well as comments describing the functions. List form of for-loops were used.

3. Running of the script. All Prompts were highlighted. Prompts to carry on with more multiplication, full or partial table, enter range for partial table, etc

**Part 2: Use C-Style for-loop**

1.Functions that would generate the types of multiplication table as well as comments describing the functions. C style form of for-loops were used.

Comparison of the list and c style form of for loop.
Both approach are unique as they carry different advantages. the c style is easier to adopt in solving the projects challenge. The list approach offers strength in understanding how seq works inorder to capture the values of the variable in the curly braces.
